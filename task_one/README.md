# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset using Python. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of the dataset's features, providing a foundation for future modeling and data science tasks.

## Contents

- [`EDA.ipynb`](EDA.ipynb): Jupyter notebook containing the full EDA workflow.
- [`IRIS.csv`](IRIS.csv): The Iris dataset used for analysis.

## Objectives

- Load and inspect the Iris dataset.
- Visualize feature distributions and relationships.
- Identify patterns and potential outliers.
- Summarize key findings to inform further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open [`EDA.ipynb`](EDA.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Ensure all required libraries are installed:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset ([`IRIS.csv`](IRIS.csv)) consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species label.

## Results

The EDA provides visualizations and statistical summaries that highlight the structure and relationships within the Iris dataset, supporting further machine learning and modeling efforts.
